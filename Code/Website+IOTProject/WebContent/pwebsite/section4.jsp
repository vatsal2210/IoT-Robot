                                    <p>" Mr.Vatsal Shah was my student for four years and I had an opportunity to see him at close quarters. Hardly few students can match him in enthusiasm, initiative, leadership and dedication. He took the initiative in leading the student association which today is providing a great opportunity to all students to exhibit their talents through various activities. He was instrumental in forming the student chapter of IEEE in Indus and motivating the students for membership. He is the founder member of Robotics club at Indus and leading a team of students across the institute in building robots and participating in national and international robotic events. He was a dedicated and sincere student and successfully carried out many projects, some on his own initiative. He would be a great asset to any company or organization. I wish him great success in all his future endeavors. "</p>

He not only has the ability of self motivation but is a great team maker & also motivates others in his team to perform to the best of their capabilities. He is a leader by natural instinct in such teams. His communication skills are varied & can be seen at play while he is interacting with his juniors, seniors, teachers, industry etc. He is a goal oriented person with clearly defined objectives & time plan based steps. His quality of work execution is of high standard. This could be seen in his robotics initiative where he merged practical learning with national goals of Clean India as the robots built by him & his team did the cleaning of university campus.I wish him all the best in his personal life & career to contribute to nation building & make this world a better place to live in."</p>
