# Summary

Hi Maker ! With the desire to create a robot thanks to electronic solutions like Arduino and Raspberry pi I needed a solution to test the code . The commercial solutions do not appear to me suitable to my needs I have decided to design my own . So this platform has emerged. I share with you , if you encounter the same problem may be that it will be able to help you.  

This is for easily and quickly mounting a robot with 2, 4 or 6 wheel drive or why not legs.   
It measures 35 cm long and 25 cm wide and 6 cm high.   
There is enough space to contain a Arduino Mega board with a motor shield .   
There are :   
A large door for easy access the interior .  
Holes for fastening standard servo and stepper motor (nema 12 up to 17) on top and bottom to move sensor , arms, camera or what you want .  
Slots for mounting sensors on the top and bottom to avoid obstacle.  
Holes for fastening DC motor and stepper motor (nema12 up to 17)   
on the sides .  
09/20/2015 Adding mounting holes for lcd 16x02 and nuts cage for door .  
The plan is intended for materials 3 mm thick .  


Here is a video that shows some possible configuration.
