# IoT-Robot
The purpose of this project is to control robot with an interface board of the Raspberry Pi, sensors and software to full fill real time requirement. Controlling DC motors, different sensors, camera interfacing with raspberry Pi using GPIO pin. Live streaming, Command the robot easily, sends data of different sensors which works automatically or control from anywhere at any time. Design of the website and control page of Robot is done using Java tools and HTML. This system works on IoT concept which is Internet of Things, where all the physical devices will connect with digital systems. This will enable raspberry pi to be used for more robotic applications and cut down the cost for building an IoT robot.
